# Checkers

Service checkers are functions that verify the correct functioning of a service, e.g., whether the service is up and running, all functionalities are still in place, and if previously inserted flags are still accessible via the intended functionalities of the service. 

## Types

Our service has two checkers at disposal:

* `**checker1**` - ensures the `webshop` functionality is working as intended as well as interacts with `Flag store 1`
* `**checker2**` - ensures the `file_server` functionality is working as intended as well as interacts with `Flag store 2`

Check out the sub-directories for more details.
